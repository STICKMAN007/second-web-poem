<h1 Style="text-align:center">The Skyline Riders</h1>
<h2 Style="text-align:center">By Henry Lawson</h2>
<p Style="text-align:center">"Against the light of a dawning white<br/>
My Skyline Riders stand,<br/>
There is trouble ahead for a dark year dead<br/>
And the selfish wrongs of a land;<br/>
There are hurrying feet of fools to repeat<br/>
The follies of Nineteen Eight,<br/>
But darkly still on each distant hill<br/>
My riders watch and wait.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">My Skyline Riders are down and gone<br/>
As far as the eye can see,<br/>
And the horses stand in the shades of dawn<br/>
Where a single man holds three.<br/>
We feel the flush and we feel the thrill<br/>
Of the coming of Nineteen Nine,<br/>
For my Skyline Riders are over the hill<br/>
And into the firing line.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">The Skyline lifts while a storm-cloud lowers,<br/>
What s that? A shot! All s well!<br/>
There is news out there for this land of ours<br/>
That the tattling rifles tell.<br/>
A thud and a thud and a flash like blood<br/>
There is light on the land at last!<br/>
Australian guns aon the nearer hills<br/>
Are talking about the past.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">O, a lonely place in the days gone by<br/>
Was the long first firing line,<br/>
Where we fought as strangers, you and I,<br/>
For the land that was yours and mine.<br/>
There was time to dream in the firing line,<br/>
There was time to starve and die, <br/>
When the only things in that world of mine<br/>
Were my Native Land and I.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">O, a lonely place was the firing line<br/>
When the gaps were wide between,<br/>
Hundreds of miles, in this land of mine<br/>
And never a soldier seen.<br/>
The dying mest die and the dead were left<br/>
Unmarked by the deadly tired,<br/>
When struck to the heart in a firing line<br/>
And there s a deadly danger yet.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">Proud of virtue, and proud of sin,<br/>
Or proud neath a cruel wrong;<br/>
Proud in failure or proud to win,<br/>
Oh, the pride of man is strong!<br/>
Proud of god or of being without<br/>
Or proud of women and wine,<br/>
But get you down from your horse of pride<br/>
And into the firing line.</p>
<p Style="text-align:center">Pride in poverty, all the same,<br/>
There s work for all men to do,<br/>
With wrong to fight there is deathless fame<br/>
To win in a land so new.<br/>
Preacher and drunkard! and sportsman and bard!<br/>
In the dawning of Nineteen Nine,<br/>
Saints and sinners! ride hard! ride hard!<br/>
They are pressed in the Firing Line.</p>
